# Fabflix

Fablix is a mock e-commerce movie database website. Users can browse for movies, get movie details, add to cart, and check out. There is also an Anroid version of the website as another front-end. To increase scalability and security, this website uses reCAPTCHA, and load balancing via master- slave instances.
